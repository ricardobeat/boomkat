# Incremental wrapper around `c3c build` — c3c always fully recompiles and
# relinks even when nothing changed (~19s), so gate each target on mtimes
# and skip the c3c invocation entirely when the binary is already newer
# than every source file that feeds it.
#
# Prerequisites are pulled from project.json at execute time (c-sources +
# the target's own "sources", expanding directory entries to their .c3
# files) so this file never drifts from what c3c itself actually builds.
