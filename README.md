# Duktape-C3

A port of the [Duktape JavaScript engine](https://duktape.org/) from C to [C3](https://c3-lang.org/).

## Status

**Work in Progress** — A functional JavaScript engine running real workloads.

- **71.8% test262 pass rate** on the targeted subset (21,121 of 29,459 executable tests, session 250); roadmap to 100% in `plans/040-test262-100-percent.md`
- **100/100 Rosetta Code tests** pass
- **Benchmarks competitive** with original Duktape v2.7.0 and QuickJS on most workloads
- **Memory usage on par** with Duktape/QuickJS for light workloads; remaining gap on heavy object/array workloads is tracked in `plans/033-memory-next-steps.md`

### Completed Modules ✅

- **`src/types.c3`** — Tagged value representation (`TVal`), NaN-boxing, heap headers, reference counting
- **`src/heap.c3`** — Heap allocation, string interning, mark-and-sweep GC, GC safe points
- **`src/hstring.c3`** — Interned UTF-8 strings, hashing, iteration, operations
- **`src/hobject.c3`** — JavaScript objects, shapes, property storage, dense arrays, prototypes
- **`src/env.c3`** — Lexical and variable environment records
- **`src/bytecode.c3`** — Instruction formats, opcodes, constant pools, disassembler
- **`src/lexer.c3`** — Full ES2015+ tokenizer (numbers, strings, templates, punctuators, strict mode)
- **`src/compiler/`** — Bytecode compiler: parser, AST, register allocation, scope management, control flow, classes, destructuring
- **`src/vm.c3`** — Register-based bytecode interpreter, call stack, inline caches, exception handling
- **`src/builtins/`** — Built-in objects and functions: Object, Array, Function, String, Number, Boolean, Date, RegExp, JSON, Math, Error, Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet, Symbol, Promise, Generator, Iterator, Global
- **`src/re_bindings.c3`** — RegExp engine bindings (libregexp)

### Build

**Runtime:** [C3 v0.8.0+](https://c3-lang.org/) — the only requirement to build and run the engine itself.

**Dev tooling** (only needed for the test262 conformance suite, benchmarks, and `just` recipes):
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) — task runner wrapping the commands below
- Python 3.6+ — orchestrates `scripts/run_test262.py` (parallel workers, RSS sampling, skip list, retry passes); stdlib only, no `pip install`
- `jq` — Makefile parses `project.json` for target sources
- `bash` — shell recipes under `scripts/` and the `justfile`
- `cc` — builds the vendored Duktape v2.7.0 CLI used for benchmark comparisons

```bash
# Default build (NaN-boxing)
c3c build

# Plain JS runner
c3c build duktape_c3
./out/duktape_c3 test/simple.js

# Inspection build (bytecode disassembly, tracing): duktape_c3_debug
c3c build duktape_c3_debug
./out/duktape_c3_debug -c test/simple.js       # disassemble, don't run

# test262 conformance suite
c3c build test262_runner
python3 scripts/run_test262.py                 # full suite
python3 scripts/run_test262.py --phase 2       # single phase (~1 min)

# Benchmark CLI
c3c build duktape_c3
just bench-memory
```

### Useful Commands

See `justfile` for all tasks. Common ones:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `just build` | Build static library |
| `just test262` | Run full test262 suite |
| `just test262-phase 2` | Run a single test262 phase |
| `just bench-memory` | Peak RSS comparison vs Duktape/QuickJS |
| `just bench` | Speed benchmarks vs Duktape/QuickJS |
| `just rosetta` | Rosetta Code tests |

### Build Flags

- `-D NONANBOX` — Disable NaN-boxing; use 16-byte tagged union `TVal`. Useful for 16-bit ESP32 targets.
- `-D NOSHAPECACHE` — Disable the per-object 8-byte shape pointer cache to save memory.

## Design Notes

[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) is the full guide: how a script
gets from source to running code, and how the compiler, VM, object model, and
collector fit together. The short version:

**Tagged values.** The default build NaN-boxes every value into 8 bytes, using
the unused payload space in IEEE 754 NaNs for undefined, null, booleans,
pointers, and 48-bit fast integers. Pass `-D NONANBOX` for a 16-byte tagged
union with the same semantics.

**Memory.** Reference counting reclaims most values immediately, and
mark-and-sweep collects the cycles it cannot. Strings are interned so equality
is pointer identity, with long strings deliberately left out to avoid concat
bloat. Object headers come from fixed-block pools.

**Bytecode VM.** Register-based, with fixed 32-bit instructions in five operand
formats, inline caches for property and variable access, hidden classes behind
those caches, and fused opcodes on the hot paths.
